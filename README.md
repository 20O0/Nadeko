#### Manual migration 

âš  NOT RECOMMENDED  
âš  NadekoBot v3 requires .net 5

1. In order to migrate your bot which is hosted on a **linux**, first update your current version to the latest 2.x version using the 2.x installer, run the bot, and make sure it works
2. Rename your old nadeko bot folder to `nadekobot_2x`
   - `mv NadekoBot nadekobot_2x`
3. Build the new version and move old data to the output folder 
   1. Clone the v3 branch to a separate folder 
      - `git clone https://gitlab.com/kwoth/nadekobot -b v3 --depth 1`
   2. Build the bot
      - `dotnet publish -c Release -o output/ src/NadekoBot/`
   3. Copy old data
      - `cp -rf nadekobot_2x/src/NadekoBot/data nadekobot/src/NadekoBot/data`
   4. Copy the database 
      - `cp nadekobot_2x/src/NadekoBot/bin/Release/netcoreapp2.1/data/NadekoBot.db nadekobot/output/data`
   5. Copy credentials file
      - `cp nadekobot_2x/src/NadekoBot/credentials.json nadekobot/output/`
4. Run the bot
   - `cd nadekobot/output`
   - `dotnet NadekoBot.dll`
5. That's it. Just make sure that when you're updating the bot, you're properly backing up your old data

### Windows From Source

###### Prerequisites

Install these before proceeding
- [.net 5](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0)  - needed to compile and run the bot
- [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) - needed to clone the repository (you can also download the zip manually and extract it but this guide assumes you're using git)
- [redis](https://github.com/MicrosoftArchive/redis/releases/download/win-3.0.504/Redis-x64-3.0.504.msi) - to cache things needed by some features and persist through restarts

###### Installation Instructions

Open PowerShell (press windows button on your keyboard and type powershell, it should show up), and navigate to the location where you want to install the bot (for example `cd ~/Desktop/`)  

1. `git clone https://gitlab.com/kwoth/nadekobot -b v3 --depth 1`
3. `dotnet publish -c Release -o output/ src/NadekoBot/`
4. `cd output && cp creds_example.yml creds.yml`
5. Open `creds.yml` with your favorite text editor (Please don't use notepad or wordpad. You can use notepad++, vscode, atom, sublime or something similar)

###### Update Instructions (todo: WIP)

Open powershell and run following commands:

1. Navigate to your bot's folder, for example `cd ~/Desktop/nadekobot`
2. Pull the latest updates (this will fail if you have custom code changes).
   - If you don't have custom code changes, just run `git pull`
   - If you do have custom code changes (changes to .cs files) You have 3 options
      - Undo all changes with `git checkout -- * && git pull`
      - Stash changes and try to re-apply them `git stash && git pull && git stash apply`
      - Commit your changes and resolve merge conflicts `git add . && git commit -m "My commit message" && git pull`
3. Re-build the bot `dotnet publish -c Release -o output/ src/NadekoBot/`
4. Run the bot `cd output && dotnet NadekoBot.dll`

#### Music prerequisites

## Creds Guide

This document aims to guide you through the process of creating a Discord account for your bot 
(the Discord Bot application), and inviting that account into your Discord server.

![Create a bot application and copy token to creds.yml file](https://cdn.nadeko.bot/tutorial/bot-creds-guide.gif)

- Go to [the Discord developer application page][DiscordApp].
- Log in with your Discord account.
- Click **New Application**
- Fill out the `Name` field (it's your app's name)
- Go to the **Bot** tab on the left sidebar.
- Click on the `Add a Bot` button and confirm that you do want to add a bot to this app.
- **Optional:** Add bot's avatar and description
- Copy Token to `creds.yml`
- Scroll down to the `Privileged Gateway Intents` section and enable both intents.
  These are required for a number of features to function properly, and should both be on.

#### Inviting your bot to your server    

![Invite the bot to your server](https://cdn.nadeko.bot/tutorial/bot-invite-guide.gif)

- On the **General Information** tab, copy your `Application ID` from your [applications page][DiscordApp].
- Replace the `YOUR_CLIENT_ID_HERE` in this link:
  `https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID_HERE&scope=bot&permissions=66186303` with your `Client ID`
- The link should now look something like this:
  `https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=123123123123&scope=bot&permissions=66186303`
- Access that newly created link, pick your Discord server, click `Authorize` and confirm with the captcha at the end
- The bot should now be in your server

That's it! You may now go back to the installation guide you were following previously ðŸŽ‰
